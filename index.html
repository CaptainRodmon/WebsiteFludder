<p>You can find me on any of those social media sites, although I must say, I'm not particually active on some, but you can still find me. I am also opening up a Minecraft server, the ip is 'code.azures.us'. This server will be all about development and creating projects and such, it will be a lot of fun. Right now, it is either not online, or it will kick you with a verification code, don't mind that. If you have any ideas for the server or development for it, email me at <a href="mailto:fluddershyy@gmail.com">fluddershyy@gmail.com</a>. I don't think I will be hiring and type of moderation or administrators, maybe one or two to keep hackers out of my server, but mostly looking for developers. Again, contact me at <a href="mailto:fluddershyy@gmail.com">fluddershyy@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;if you are a developer with 1+ year(s) of Java and Bukkit experience, contact me! All our projects will be free, documented, and open-source. I can't wait as this will be so much fun.</p>
