<p>- Potion Teller: If a player is splashed with a potion, it sends them a message of who splashed them, the intensity and duration of the splash(rounding), and type of potion(all configurable). If a player drinks a potion, it does practically the same thing. This was a small project I've completed for $5.</p>
<p>- StaffPin: This is a simple plugin that I have created that allows 2 step verification for staff members with a certain permission. For say, if a staff (with permission), had set a pin number, and logged in, it would not let them chat, use commands, or move before the pin was set! This was a small project I've completed for free.</p>
<p>- SellWand: This was a medium plugin that I have created that allows you to sell items with (Vault implementation) a wand! If you had permission, you could right-click a chest with this wand, and it would sell all the items; without metadata of course. You wouldn't want a like Uber Item or something be sold for a tenth of it's price, would you? So, then it would display (configurable messages) in chat of whatever you sold, and the total price. Here is what the layout looked this:</p>
<p>header: 'You sold:'<br />items: '%item% - %price-per-item% - %amount% - %worth%'<br />footer: 'Total: %price%'</p>
<p>- MultiverseWorldAlert: This was a small plugin that I have created that allows staff to receive messages (with multiverse) to alert them when a player (or staff) has changed a world. This used Multiverse Alias name, so it used that. Here's how it worked:<br />When a player changes a world: If a player with "world.player" has that permission, he/she will get alerted, but not the other way around (if the player doesn't have permission). <br />When a staff changes a world: If a player with "world.player" has that permission, he/she will not get alerted, but other staff would(if the player doesn't have permission).<br />When the owner changes a world: Will not alert anyone of this, but when anyone changes a world, he will.<br />So:<br />world.player can see an other player with that permission or a regular one.<br />world.staff can see players change worlds, and other staff with the same permission.<br />world.owner can see everyone change worlds, but no one can see him/her change worlds.<br />I have completed this for $10.</p>
<p>- Anvil: This is a large plugin I did that I really can't explain, you can upgrade items with the help of another plugin I created (Item Maker), and you can buy scrolls, and 2 other items (trina and karvidis) and use those, change the percentage of them (in chat) and you lose perchatage of getting your item, the higher you go (level). This was a large plugin that I completed for $40.</p>
<p>- ItemMaker: This was sort of a dependent plugin for my other plugin (Anvil) to work. This just created the items for you. You could add all different types of attributes and stuff to the item and lores, rename and set the level the item is at. This is also a plugin I can't explain fully, due to it's complexity. This was a medium plugin I completed for $30.</p>
<p>- DuelsByFludder: This is a personally project I created. Yet again, due to it's complexity, I can't explain too much. Basically, it was a remake of all those PracticePvP servers you've played. You could duel other players with gapple and pot pvp and join a queue. Once another player joined (the type of gamemode) you we're sent to an arena to 1v1. I added a cooldown, that you could bypass with a certain permission if you wanted ranks or what not.</p>
<p>- Families: With this plugin, you could get married, kiss, have sexual intercourse, and in one plugin, along with the option of selecting your gender when you log in, and up to the server owners if they want to disable or allow homosexual relationships. This plugin is extremely configurable and I've created this because I was an iPhone app similar to this.</p>
