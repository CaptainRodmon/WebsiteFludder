<h1>Servers</h1>
<p>Okay, so I have not worked for many servers, mainly because it's not my thing, but I've been coming out of my comfort zone and I am currently working for a minigame network and HCF network. I have worked for 2 other (faction) servers, and had many clients, which is where all my plugins I created went.</p>
